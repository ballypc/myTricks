The myTricks is a copyrighted work and cannot be used legally without
a software license. In order to make this  project usable to a vast
majority of developers, I distribute it under two mutually exclusive
open-source licenses, like the FreeType Project.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when using myTricks in
any of your projects or products.

  - The myTricks License, found in the file 'MTL.TXT', which is actually
    a 3-clause BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you to explicitly cite the myTricks project in your product's
    DOCUMENTATION. All details are in the license file. This license
    is suited to products which don't use the GNU General Public
    License.

    Note that this license is compatible with the GNU General Public
    License (GNU GPL) v3.

  - The GNU General Public License version 2 (GNU GPLv2), found in
    'GPLv2.TXT' (or ANY LATER version can be used too), for programs
    which already use the GPL.

    Note that the GPLv2 is INcompatible with the GPLv3.
